# Instructions

1. Make your ip static
2. Set you ip to 192.168.100.40
3. install python
4. install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. run the server with `fastapi run main.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`
6. Done!

at this point if there is no errors the server should be working. If you encountered errors dont hesitate to reach out to me

Note: I suggest that when you demonstrate your app modify the Cotton Buds account directly on the sqlite database as it is already populated with data and will be much easier to present
